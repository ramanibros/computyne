      <p>Freight bills audit and payment play a crucial role in the world of logistics. Freight billing is a complicated task, and the chances of errors are high. The global freight transportation market was valued at $10 trillion in 2022 (≈7% of global GDP) and is projected to grow to $15.5 trillion by 2027; with such trade volumes, companies cannot afford even minor errors in freight billing. Hence, <a href="https://www.computyne.com/outsource-freight-audit-services"><strong>Freight audit services</strong></a><strong> </strong>act as a helping hand to businesses around the globe. The freight audit process not only catches errors but also contributes to major improvements in the overall cost savings.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>The Importance of Freight Audit and Payment</strong></p>
